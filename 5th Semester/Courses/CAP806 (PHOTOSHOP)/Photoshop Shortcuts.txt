Photoshop is a image and video editing tool. It is a raster based programme which means it uses pixels to work with images.

A vector mask is a resolution-independent path that clips out the contents of the layer.

Embedding takes the placed content and puts the entirety of it within your working file.

Linking the file takes the placed content and creates a dynamic link from that object to your Photoshop file.
